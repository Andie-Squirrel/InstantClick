# InstantClick
Instant Install for Quality Autoclicking

Allows the user to enable and disable autoclicking using only mouse buttons.

Run `install-requirements.bat` to install all requirements. Then simply run `python Squirrelia.AUTOCLICKER.py`, or if that doesn't work run `python Alternative.AUTOCLICKER.py`.

Once running, you can choose to display the delay between clicks. Autoclicking can be enabled by holding down the left-mouse button and middlemouse-clicking. To disable, simply right-click or middle-mouse click again.
